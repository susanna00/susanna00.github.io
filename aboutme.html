<p>My name is Susanna Roman√≤ and I am currently a junior in the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, double-majoring in Operations and Information Management and Marketing. When I am not studying you can find me riding a horse, reading a thriller by the Potomac, or cooking some delicious italian dishes. </p>
